# Lichess Dataset Analysis
This dataset was taken from kaggle. It has a lot of useful columns like who won the game, time taken, number of moves, opening type etc... 

Exploratory Data analysis was done on the dataset and visualisation was done in seaborn.
Created appropriate columns like the game format (classified the game as Bullet, Rapid, Classical) and performed analysis based on that
